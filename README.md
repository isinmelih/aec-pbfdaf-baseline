#🔊 AEC PBFDAF Baseline

This repository provides a **real-time acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) baseline** based on a **Partitioned Block Frequency-Domain Adaptive Filter (PBFDAF)**.

The implementation is designed for **research, benchmarking, and educational purposes**, emphasizing measurable behavior and real-time constraints.

---

##🔑 Key Features

- Real-time PBFDAF-based adaptive filtering  
- Double-talk detection  
- Online ERLE measurement and convergence statistics  
- Clear separation between core processing and GUI control  

> This project prioritizes **clarity and correctness** over product-level optimizations.

## ⚖️ Citation & Usage Etiquette

This repository is provided as a **baseline and research reference** for acoustic echo cancellation using PBFDAF.

If you use this codebase, architecture, or ideas in:

- Academic publications  
- Theses  
- Technical reports  
- Blog posts  
- Derivative implementations  

Please **cite or clearly acknowledge** this repository.  
This repository is intended to be referenced as a **baseline**, not rebranded as an original end-to-end AEC system.
