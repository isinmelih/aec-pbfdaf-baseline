# AEC PBFDAF Baseline

This repository provides a real-time acoustic echo cancellation (AEC)
baseline based on a Partitioned Block Frequency-Domain Adaptive Filter
(PBFDAF).

The implementation is designed for research, benchmarking, and
educational purposes, with an emphasis on measurable behavior and
real-time constraints.

Key features include:
- Real-time PBFDAF-based adaptive filtering
- Double-talk detection
- Online ERLE measurement and convergence statistics
- Clear separation between core processing and GUI control

This project intentionally prioritizes clarity and correctness over
product-level optimizations.

## Citation & Usage Etiquette

This repository is provided as a **baseline and research reference**
for acoustic echo cancellation using PBFDAF.

If you use this codebase, architecture, or ideas in:
- academic publications
- theses
- technical reports
- blog posts
- derivative implementations

please **cite or clearly acknowledge** this repository.

This repository is intended to be referenced as a **baseline**, not
rebranded as an original end-to-end AEC system.

### Usage Notes
- This project is **not intended to claim novelty or state-of-the-art performance**
- It is designed for learning, evaluation, and controlled experimentation
- Modifications and extensions should be clearly documented by downstream users

While the Apache 2.0 license permits reuse, **ethical academic practice**
requires transparent attribution.
