# AEC PBFDAF Baseline

This repository provides a real-time acoustic echo cancellation (AEC)
baseline based on a Partitioned Block Frequency-Domain Adaptive Filter
(PBFDAF).

The implementation is designed for research, benchmarking, and
educational purposes, with an emphasis on measurable behavior and
real-time constraints.

Key features include:
- Real-time PBFDAF-based adaptive filtering
- Double-talk detection
- Online ERLE measurement and convergence statistics
- Clear separation between core processing and GUI control

This project intentionally prioritizes clarity and correctness over
product-level optimizations.
